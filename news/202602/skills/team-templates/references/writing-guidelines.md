# Team writing and hygiene guidelines (quick reference)

Use these rules when generating templates for the team:

- Prefer **deliverable-first** output (a complete doc) over advice.
- Use **placeholders** like `{{field}}` only when the user did not provide the info.
- Keep checklists as `- [ ]` so they can be tracked.
- For incidents: focus on **systems and process**, not individuals.
- For access requests: use **groups/roles**, not per-person grants, unless explicitly asked.
